## Overview

ESG analysis evaluates companies based on their performance across three critical dimensions:

1. **Environmental (E)**: How a company performs as a steward of the natural environment, including resource usage, carbon emissions, waste management, and climate risk exposure.

2. **Social (S)**: How a company manages relationships with its workforce, the communities in which it operates, and the political environments where it does business.

3. **Governance (G)**: The internal system of practices, controls, and procedures a company adopts to govern itself, make effective decisions, comply with the law, and meet the needs of external stakeholders.

## Benefits of ESG Analysis

### Risk Management

- Reduced risk of catastrophic losses
- Stronger stakeholder relationships
- Greater innovation potential
- Better talent attraction and retention

ESG analysis helps you:

- Align your investments with your personal or organizational values

## Technical Implementation

TradeLens sources ESG data from multiple providers and proprietary algorithms to create a comprehensive view:

- **Core ESG Metrics**: Obtained from industry-leading ESG data providers.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of news and social media.
- **Transaction Pattern Analysis**: Evaluation of trading patterns that may reflect ESG sentiment.

The system employs sophisticated weighting methodologies to account for:

## Best Practices

For optimal use of the ESG analysis feature:

1. **Check coverage indicator**: Ensure sufficient data is available for meaningful analysis.
2. **Focus on material issues**: Prioritize ESG factors most relevant to each company's industry.
3. **Consider trend direction**: Improving ESG scores may be more important than absolute values.
